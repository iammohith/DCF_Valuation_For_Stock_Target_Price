# DCF_Valuation_For_Stock_Target_Price

**A robust, professional-grade Python CLI tool for Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) stock valuation.**  
This tool provides comprehensive, transparent, and customizable DCF analysis for both casual investors and financial professionals.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Accurate DCF Valuation:** Calculates intrinsic stock value using Free Cash Flow, with robust fallback logic (Operating Cash Flow - CapEx, Net Income).
- **Outlier Handling:** Automatically detects and removes outlier cash flow years for more realistic growth estimates.
- **Growth Rate Calculation:** Computes FCF CAGR or allows user override.
- **Flexible Terminal Value:** Supports both perpetual growth and terminal multiple methods.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Interactive tables show valuation impact across discount and terminal growth rates.
- **Data Provenance:** Clearly reports all data sources and fallback logic.
- **Comprehensive Output:** Step-by-step explanations, tabular breakdowns, warnings, recommendations, and visualizations.
- **CSV Export:** Save detailed results for further analysis.
- **Charting:** Visualizes projected cash flows and present values.
- **CLI & Scripting:** All features accessible from the command line for integration into research pipelines or investment dashboards.

## üìä Output Details

### **Verbose Mode (Default)**

- **Assumptions:** All user inputs and detected data, with explanations
- **Historical Free Cash Flows:** Tabular, with outlier notes and fallback explanations
- **Growth Rate:** Calculated CAGR or user override
- **Projections:** Year-by-year FCF projections
- **DCF Calculation:** Full table showing FCF, PV, present value sum, terminal value, and equity value
- **Sensitivity Table:** Price per share for a range of discount and terminal growth rates
- **Warnings/Recommendations:** Data caveats, suggestions, fallback usage
- **Export/Visualization:** CSV file path and chart shown if requested

### **Summary Mode**

- Condensed snapshot of intrinsic value, sensitivity table, and key warnings.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:** Financials (FCFs, shares outstanding, debts) pulled via [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).
2. **Cleaning:** Outliers in FCF history are automatically detected/removed.
3. **Growth Rate:** By default, calculated as CAGR of (cleaned) FCFs. You can override this.
4. **Projection:** Next N years of FCF are projected using the growth rate.
5. **Terminal Value:** Choose perpetual growth or terminal multiple method.
6. **Discounting:** All future cash flows and terminal value are discounted to present value.
7. **Valuation:** Adds up discounted cash flows, subtracts net debt, divides by shares outstanding.
8. **Sensitivity:** Valuation recalculated for a grid of discount/terminal growth rates, shown in table.
9. **Output:** All steps, calculations, and warnings are clearly presented. Optional CSV/chart export.

## üèÜ Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Always review the warnings.** If fallback data is used or outliers removed, check the reasonableness of results.
- **Sensitivity analysis** is your friend: see how robust your valuation is to small changes in assumptions.
- **Override the growth rate** if you have a strong thesis the future will differ from the past.
- **Use the CSV export** to compare multiple companies or scenarios in Excel/Sheets.
- **Visualize** with the built-in chart for intuition.
- **Keep Python and dependencies up to date** for best data and security.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Extension

- **Change outlier thresholds:** Edit `dcf/data.py` and `dcf/calculations.py` for stricter/looser filtering.
- **Add new output formats:** Enhance `dcf/output.py` for PDF, HTML, or Excel.
- **Plug in alternative data sources:** Swap out `yfinance` calls in `dcf/data.py`.
- **Batch or automated runs:** Integrate with your own scripts or research pipeline.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Limitations

- Relies on public financial data. Always double-check results versus primary sources.
- Only as accurate as the underlying assumptions (growth, terminal value, discount rate).
- Does not model debt/equity raises, buybacks, or other advanced scenarios.

---

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ For Developers

- Modular, PEP8-compliant codebase
- Add new valuation models easily (see `dcf/calculations.py`)
- CLI interface is argparse-based for easy extension
- PRs and feature requests are welcome!

## üôã FAQ

**Q: Why does the tool sometimes use Net Income instead of FCF?**  
A: If Free Cash Flow is missing, we fall back to Operating Cash Flow minus CapEx, then Net Income as a last resort. Any fallback is clearly reported in the output.

**Q: Can I run this for non-US tickers?**  
A: Yes! The tool detects currency from the ticker and reports all numbers in that currency.

**Q: Can I use this as a Python library?**  
A: Yes! Import modules from `dcf/` into your own scripts for custom workflows.
